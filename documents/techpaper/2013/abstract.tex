%In the context of the AUVSI and ONR's Xth International Autonomous
%Underwater Vehicle Competition, the team at the University of Toronto
%built an underwater vehicle.

AquaTux is the fourth entry of the University of Toronto Mechatronics
Design Association into the annual Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
Competition.  The vehicle is designed to autonomously complete
the set of tasks described in the mission\footnotemark[1].
It is equipped with an IMU, a depth sensor,
and two cameras that allow it to navigate in its environment.
This year's frame was reused from previous years.
We are proud to present new electronics, a new power system,
a new embedded system using an FPGA, and new software.
