# Joining #

To join the club, subscribe to our [mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/mda-utoronto/) to get information about future meetings. We meet once a week usually. These meetings are where we sit down discuss different aspects of the project and are very open and everyone is welcome to attend. If you are new to MDA, consider stopping by one of these meetings to see what MDA is all about.

For other inquiries, you can send an email to mech DOT design AT utoronto.ca

To gain access to the [code](http://code.google.com/p/mda-ut/), you need to bug us so we can add you to our SVN repository (you can download and modify the code without being added, but to commit you need access). Code access will also let you edit this wiki.
