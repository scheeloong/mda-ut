%In the context of the AUVSI and ONR's Xth International Autonomous
%Underwater Vehicle Competition, the team at the University of Toronto
%built an underwater vehicle.

AquaTux is the third entry of the University of Toronto Mechatronics
Design Association into the annual Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
Competition.  The vehicle is designed to autonomously complete
the set of tasks described in the mission\footnotemark[1]. It is
equipped with a passive sonar system, a compass, a depth sensor and two cameras that allow it to navigate in its environment. This
year's frame was built from the ground up based on the experience
acquired from past entries and is much more adapted to the underwater
conditions and the rigors of the competition. Along with the frame, we are
proud to present a new power system and more reliable electronics and
embedded communication protocols.
