Directory: root
Use: Should hold all the MDA PCB projects

Editors:

Every unique board should have it's own directory.
Updated revisions of an existing board should be kept in originals directory. 

Unlike what Mark had previously stated. We support both EAGLE and ALTIUM for PCB development. Pick your poison. 

Do not commit generated files such as Gerbers unless they are final revisions.
