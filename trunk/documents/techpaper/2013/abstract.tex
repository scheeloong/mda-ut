%In the context of the AUVSI and ONR's Xth International Autonomous
%Underwater Vehicle Competition, the team at the University of Toronto
%built an underwater vehicle.

AquaTux is the fourth entry of the University of Toronto Mechatronics
Design Association into the annual Autonomous Underwater Vehicle
Competition.  The vehicle is designed to autonomously complete
the set of tasks described in the mission\footnotemark[1]. It is
equipped with a passive sonar system, an IMU, a depth sensor and
two cameras that allow it to navigate in its environment. This
year's frame was reused from previous years.
We are proud to present a new power system, more reliable electronics,
new embedded communication protocol using an FPGA, and new software.
