\section{Conclusions} 
\vspace{-.03in}

This year's team took on the challenge of building all of Aquatux's electronics
and software within the existing frame. This AUV is composed of a Netbook that
is linked to a single FPGA that drives the electronic peripherals.
The Netbook runs mission-aware vision software, which uses the OpenCV library.
Circuit board fabrication, plastic machining, embedded programming,
and software engineering are some
of the skills that many of our members were able to acquire. More
rational design techniques and project management skills are also
derived from the our previous competitions and they had a significant
effect on maximizing the productivity of all the man-hours contributed
to the project.
