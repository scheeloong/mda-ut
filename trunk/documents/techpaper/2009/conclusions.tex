\section{Conclusions} 
\vspace{-.03in}

This year's team took on the challenge of building a completely new
autonomous underwater vehicle: AquaTux. This AUV is composed of an embedded
computer that is linked to an interconnection of microcontrollers. More emphasis was directed towards the frame to
ensure that the electronics remain dry. While a lot of the design
decisions are influence by our past experience, we also learned many
techniques and principles over the last year. Circuit board
fabrication, plastic machining and software engineering are some of
the skills that many of our members were able to acquire. More
rational design techniques and project management skills are also
derived from the our previous competitions and they had a significant
effect on maximizing the productivity of all the man-hours contributed
to the project.
