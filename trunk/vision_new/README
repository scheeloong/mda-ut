This is the second iteration in writing a good vision code system.
Main Goals
  - Seperation of layers of code:
    - img/filter layer, task layer, mission layer
  - Use .msf text files to store configuration info
  - Better interface between vision and control
  - Minimize explicit use of opencv in main functions

Important Things:
  - You need a "common_settings.msf" in settings, which contains the minimum
    needed config info to start the system. This is extensively hardcoded
  - Each filter and task has its own settings file
