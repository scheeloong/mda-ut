# this file defines constants used in the Hough Lines algorithm
PIXEL_RESOLUTION 2 # step size in pixels, > 1 means the line finder skips pixels
ANGULAR_RESOLUTION 0.017 # step size in angles (radians)

# how many points a line must pass through to be accepted by the alg
_ACCUMULATOR_THRESHOLD_, 0.14   # scaled by image wdith
# minimum accepted line length in pixels
_MIN_LINE_LENGTH_, 0.1          # scaled by image width
# colinear lines must be this far apart to be considered two lines
_MIN_COLINEAR_LINE_DIST_ 0.1   # scaled by image width
