Transformer winding calculations.
0) Design Parameters
Frequency: 12-30kHz
Power Dissipated: < 1W
Primary Voltage:   40Vpp
Secondary Voltage: 240Vpp (6 x turns ratio)

1) Magnetic losses
B = |V| / A w N
  where A = cross-sectional area
	N = number of turns
	w = angular frequency
	V = voltage amplitude (NOT rms)
	B = peak magnetic field (T)

For the ETD59 core used in the transformer (3F3 ferrite),
	A = 368 mm^2
	V = 51500 mm^3

	P = V * 10kW/m^3 @ 100mT, 25kHz (3F3 material)
	  = 0.515W (significant)
Thus, we plan to design the transformer with a max 50mT B-field.

Considering the primary (fewer turns), we have:
	|V| = 20V
	B   = 0.05T
	A   = 363mm^2
	w   = 2*pi*12e3;
	N   = (20)/(362e-6)(2*pi*12e3)(0.05) = 14.5 turns minimum

2) Shunt inductance
Inductance of core is given by:
L = N^2 A_L
  where A_L = 5.6 uH for the ETD59 core

If we try N = 31, we get:
	L = 25^2 (5.6uH) = 5380uH
At 12kHz, this has an impedance of 405 ohms, which is acceptably high.

3) Resistance calculations
	24AWG wire: 25.3 ohms/1000ft
	32AWG wire: 159.7 ohms/1000ft
Using a 25mm bobbin, we have ~80mm = 0.262 ft/turn.
Using N_primary = 31, N_secondary = 186:
	L_primary   = 6.55 ft
	L_secondary = 39.3 ft
With 24AWG wire (32AWG is unecessarily lossy):
	R_primary   = 0.166 ohms
	R_secondary = 0.994 ohms
Since the primary has 6x the current of the secondary, the primary is currently ~6x lossier than the secondary.
Thus, it is probably a good idea to use multiple strans for the primary.

Using 4 x 24AWG wire for the primary, 1x 24AWG for the secondary:
	R_primary   = 0.041 ohms
	R_secondary = 0.994 ohms

4) Turns per layer of bobbin
24AWG ~ 3/5mm = 0.6mm
Thus, with our 4cm bobbin => 66 turns / layer maximum (60 is easily achievable).

FINAL DESIGN:
-------------
Turns Ratio     - 1:6
Primary Turns   - 31
Secondary Turns - 186
Wire            - 24AWG (1x for secondary, 4x for primary)

Transformer winding details
- secondary: 186 total (placed on INSIDE of winding)
	=> 1 x 24AWG
	=> layer 1 - 67
	     "   2 - 59
	     "   3 - 60
- primary: 31 total (placed on OUTSIDE of winding)
	=> 4 x 24AWG (to reduce winding resistance)
	=> layer 1 - 16
	     "   2 - 15
- used fish paper between all layers, and fully impregnated with red insulating varnish, to fully insulate the windings

- tested and characterized transformer: quite impressive performance (measured characteristics using sine-wave generator, resistor, & scope)
	=> 6:1 ratio (+/- 0.3%) from 10-40kHz
	=> primary (fewer turns) leakage inductance: 6.14uH (10kHz) - 5.13uH (40kHz)
	=> primary (fewer turns) shunt impedance: 432 ohms (10kHz) - 4657 ohms (40kHz)
		- antiresonance @ 36kHz (shunt impedance goes to ~10,000 ohms)
		- inductive below 36kHZ, capacitive above 36kHz
	=> impedances of secondary are same as primary, except *approximately* converted via the impedance ratio (36 times larger)
- tested amplifier with transformer (open load), and 2 x 1uF capacitors in series with the primary coil
	=> no oscillations or other issues with amplifier
	=> successfully measured ~230Vpp at output of transformer using oscilloscope
	=> no distortions in transformer output signal

*** IMPORTANT ***: oscillator in pinger driver (oscillator) does NOT start unless the POSITIVE supply rail is turned on FIRST.

- characterized the impedance of the ultrasound transducer (Sensor Technology Limited SQ09 Transmit/Recieve hydrophone) using a sine-wave generator, resistor, and scope
	=> impedance modelled well by a 10nF capacitor over most of 10kHz - 40kHz range
	=> encounter some sort of acoustic resonance @ 30-33kHz: the impedance briefly transitions from capacitive to resistive, and the impedance becomes very sensitive to the presence of water (the addition of water can increase the impedance by a factor of two)
	=> over the rest of the range, the transducer is fairly insensitive to the presence of water; the impedance changes by less than 20%
		- tested pinger driver with ultrasound transducer: success!
	=> used total system: sine-wave generator, power amplifier, and transformer
	=> great performance: no stability issues, ringing, etc.
	=> over most of frequency range (12kHz - 32kHz), able to use max amplitude setting (~240Vpp)
	=> from ~28-31kHz (corresponding to resonance of transducer):
		- too much current drawn from power supplies used, which went into current-limiting mode
		- no distortion / current limiting if output is reduced to ~170-180Vpp
	=> system should work over entire range at 240Vpp if we use batteries

- fully tested the pinger driver with the ultrasound transducer: everything works well
- minor issue: when using external trigger, there is ~50mS delay until the output signal turns off (design error)
- measured frequency vs. frequency knob setting:
