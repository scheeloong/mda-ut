### HoughLines 
PIXEL_RESOLUTION 2 # step size in pixels, > 1 means the line finder skips pixels
ANGULAR_RESOLUTION 0.017 # step size in angles (radians)

### how many points a line must pass through to be accepted by the alg
_ACCUMULATOR_THRESHOLD_, 0.1   # scaled by image wdith
# minimum accepted line length in pixels
_MIN_LINE_LENGTH_, 0.3          # scaled by image width
# colinear lines must be this far apart to be considered two lines
_MIN_COLINEAR_LINE_DIST_ 0.3   # scaled by image width


### HoughCircles
CANNY_HIGH_THRESHOLD, 50
_MIN_CENTER_DIST_, 0.5

### lines clustering
# the following value specifies when the algorithm should choose 1 cluster over 
# 2 clusters (because the clustering goodness metric is undefined for 1 cluster)
# Roughly speaking:
#  If the 2 lines in the cluster is seperated by more than the value below,
#  then 2 clusters will be used. Otherwise 1 cluster is used
_MIN_DIST_BETWEEN_PARALLEL_LINES_, 0.02
