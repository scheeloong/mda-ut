# This is how much the image will be downsampled when generating
# (but not checking the validity of) the circles. Higher means
# faster but less accurate circles. 5 is good.

# This is the min radius of the candidate circle generated, scaled by
# image width
_MIN_RADIUS_, 0.1

# This is the fraction of points on a candidate need to be supported
# in the image for it to be a "good" circle
_THRESHOLD_, 0.6

# Number of valid candidates to generate before algorithm stops. 
# Note the algorithm still averages similar candidates together, so
# it may return less circles than this
N_CIRCLES_GENERATED, 15

# Any circle that is not supported by this many valid candidates
# is not supported
