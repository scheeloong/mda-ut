# settings needed for the circle finding algorithm

# This is how much the image will be downsampled when generating
# (but not checking the validity of) the circles. Higher means
# faster but less accurate circles. 5 is good.
DOWNSAMPLING_FACTOR, 5

# This is the min radius of the circle generated, scaled by
# image width
_MIN_RADIUS_, 0.1

# This is the fraction of points on a circle need to be supported
# in the image for it to be a "good" circle
_THRESHOLD_, 0.5

# Number of valid circles to generate before algorithm stops. 
# Note the algorithm still averages similar circles together, so
# it may return less circles than this
N_CIRCLES_REQUIRED, 10
