# this file defines constants used in the Hough Lines algorithm
PIXEL_RESOLUTION 2 # step size in pixels, > 1 means the line finder skips pixels
ANGULAR_RESOLUTION 0.017 # step size in angles (radians)
ACCUMULATOR_THRESHOLD, 140 # how many points a line must pass through to be accepted by the alg
MIN_LINE_LENGTH, 60 # minimum accepted line length in pixels
MIN_COLINEAR_LINE_DIST 50 # colinear lines must be this far apart to be considered two lines
