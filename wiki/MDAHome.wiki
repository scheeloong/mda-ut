= The MDA Wiki =

Hello everyone, this is the University of Toronto Mechatronics Design Association Wiki.

Check us out at http://mdaskule.wordpress.com

This wiki is to be used to keep documentation for the club.
It would be nice if new joiners could use this wiki to get up to speed with some of the club's stuff.
It can also get pretty technical and allow people working on the same project to keep track of what each other are doing.

*_IMPORTANT NOTE_: TO THOSE WHO EDIT THE WIKI, PLEASE KEEP IT ORGANIZED AND FOLLOW THE TOP-DOWN STRUCTURE IT'S ALREADY IN. IF POSTS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE THEN THERE IS NO USE. THANK YOU! *
