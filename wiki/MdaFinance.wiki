To get money, every year we apply for fund from different resources, mainly the different departments at U of T (Engineering Science, ECE and MIE), Alumni Funding, Engineering Society (Eng Soc). These entities each have their own deadlines and you must look out for their notifications or emails (for example Alumni has 3 deadlines, start of summer, September, and January). Others (like ECE department) you have to approach them basically anytime. These are responsibilities ideally designated to our external relations person. 

Once we have money, in general transactions require co-signers: the president and the treasurer. 

== University funding ==

Approach the following:
  * Eng Soc (you can do that anytime, the sooner the better)
  * Alumni (do this before Jan 1st)
  * Engineering Science
  * ECE
  * Mechanical

== Approaching Companies ==

This first part should be done by the external relations team:
  * Contact a company
  * Get them interested
  * Agree with the conditions of their donation
  * Get to the point where the transfer is ready

This point here is a bit tricky, because for in kind donations, you can just forward the results to the Treasurer, but if money is involved, I would rather that this part be done by the Treasurer.
  * Discuss how to transfer the money or how to ship the equipment / cheque
  * Give our mailing address (ClubInfo) (or account numbers for direct deposit, I do not know if this is possible)
  * Pick up the package from Eng Soc.(Discuss with the president on how to do this when time comes, I don't think anybody will be able to pick up stuff from Barbara, at least I hope not)
  * Keep track of the donation, ie send important information to the treasurer and the Communication Directors so that they can update our website
  * Save an email here in the wiki somewhere so that we can contact them in the future.

This will be done by the communication guys when the time comes
  * Keep in touch with our sponsors by sending them an update of what we have accomplished
