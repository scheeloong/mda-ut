== Get Ubuntu ==
Simply download a disk image from the Ubuntu website and mount it on your USB using http://unetbootin.sourceforge.net/|Unetbootin. <br>
If you want you can also get the Windows Installer (http://www.ubuntu.com/download/desktop => Download Windows Installer).
  * Ubuntu 10 (http://releases.ubuntu.com/10.10/) is most similar to the Redhat systems in the ECF labs.
  * Ubuntu 11 and up (http://releases.ubuntu.com/11.10/) has a more Mac-like UI.

== Install Packages ==

{{{
sudo apt-get install build-essential openssh-server subversion freeglut3-dev libncurses5-dev aptitude
sudo apt-get install libcv-dev libcv2.1 libcvaux-dev libcvaux2.1 libhighgui-dev libhighgui2.1
}}}

If you get errors on the second command, try:

{{{
aptitude search libcv
}}}

If you see something like libcv2.3 pop up, then type:

{{{
sudo apt-get install libopencv-dev libcv-dev libcv2.3 libcvaux-dev libcvaux2.3 libhighgui-dev libhighgui2.3
}}}

To be able to compile the technical paper:

{{{
sudo apt-get install texlive-base texlive-fonts-recommended texlive-latex-base texlive-latex-recommended texlive-latex-extra
}}}

== Become a Member ==
